The Beer law option is very simple but generally fairly accurate for high density homogeneous crops, but may rapidly yield unsatisfying predictions for stands with higher structural complexity (e.g. perennial plantations or mixed crops). For mixed crops, the model uses the radiation transfer model in a particular manner that is described in further details below. For the case of intercrops, the model first set the taller crop as “dominant”, and the shorter crop as “dominated”. The model then compute the radiation interception of each one according to the dominancy, the structure (height, width, light extinction coefficient…) and position (interrow distance, row orientation) of the species. Of course, the dominancy of each plant species can be inverted if the dominated plant become taller than the dominant plant, and the model checks every day for such a case. j=1 # julian day (DOY= Day Of Year) ir= 1 # Interrow distance l= 0.2 # Width of the plant crown rap= 0.5 # Thickness to width ratio haut= 1. # Height of the part of the dominant plant above the dominated plant # = hauteurzero = P_hautbase-originehaut # with originehaut= dominated plant height P_forme= 1 # Plant shape code (1= rectangle, 2= upside triangle, 3= downside tr.) alpha= 0 # Row orientation lat= 43.61 # Latitude in degrees trg= 25 # Global radiation rdif= 0.4 # Diffuse fraction of the atmospheric radiation P_ktrou= 0.2 # Light extinction coefficient of the dominant plant lai= 2 # Leaf area index of the dominant plant eai= 0 # Equivalent leaf area index, = photosynthetic surface that is not from # leaves (e.g. wheat ears, rapeseed siliquae, pea pods or grapes during their green stage) To facilitate understanding, we will use a common intercrop example throughout the whole document. We take a mixed crop simulated for the day of the year 1 with a global radiation of 25 MJ m-2 day-1 (= 12 MJ m-2 day-1 of PAR), and a diffuse fraction of light of 0.4, an interrow spacing of 1 meter, a shape of 1 (1= rectangle, 2= upside triangle and 3= downside rectangle), a canopy width of 0.2 meter, a canopy thickness of 0.1 meter, a row orientation of 0 relative to the North-South axis at latitude 43.61 degrees north, an LAI of 2, a light extinction coefficient of 0.2. The canopy of the dominant plant is 1 meter above the dominated plant. All code used in this document can be viewed in each section by clicking on the Code button on the right. 2.2 Plant shape Each plant radiation interception is computed using an approximation of its shape (P_forme= 1, rectangle, = 2 upside triangle, = 3 downside triangle), leaf area index (lai or p(i)%lai(ens,n)), height, width, density at emergence and leaf area density (dfol). 2.2.1 Plant width computation First, the plant width is computed using the formplante function. This computation is possible thanks to the relationship between two ways for computing the plant leaf area, where one of them uses the plant width: First, assuming the plant has a square footprint (i.e. plant projection is square), we can find the plant leaf area using the leaf area index (lai) and the plant density: \\(LA=\\frac{\\left(lai+laisen+eai\\right)}{densite}\\) which is the equivalent to: \\(LA=\\left(lai+laisen+eai\\right)\\cdot interrang\\cdot distrang\\) where lai is the leaf area index, laisen is the senescent leaf area index, eai is the equivalent leaf area of the photosynthetic organs that are not leaves (e.g. flower buds), interrang is the inter-row spacing and distrang the intra-row distance. Second, using the leaf area density and the plant volume such as: \\(LA=dfol\\cdot largeur\\cdot epaisseur\\cdot profondeur\\) for a cuboid and \\(LA=dfol\\cdot\\frac{1}{2}\\cdot\\left(largeur\\cdot epaisseur\\cdot profondeur\\right)\\) for a triangular prism, where dfol is the leaf area density, largeur is the plant width (also called largtrans), epaisseur is the plant thickness and profondeur is the plant depth. Knowing both equations, and assuming the two following hypothesis: The plant depth is equal to the plant width The intra-row distance between two plants is equal to the plant width We can now compute the plant width as: \\(largeur=\\sqrt{\\frac{(lai+laisen+eai)\\cdot interrang}{dfol\\cdot varrapforme}}\\) where varrapforme (or raptrans further) is the ratio between the plant thickness and width and is computed as \\(varrapforme=\\frac{(hauteur-P_{hautbase})}{largeur}\\) where hauteur is the total plant height, P_hautbase is the plant (i.e. crown) base height and largeur is the plant width (see fig 2.1 for more details) Figure 2.1: Diagram representing the different parameters used to compute plant width. The different names used in the model are shown between parenthesis 2.2.2 Plant width correction If the dominated plant is higher than the base height of the dominant plant, the radiation interception of the dominant plant is partially reduced, by reducing the volume that can intercept light to the canopy volume above the dominated plant only. This correction is made to consider the competition for light between the two species, and is computed according to the shape of the plant. Consequently, the model first compute the height of the dominated plant (sc%originehaut) by looking for the maximum height between the sunlit and shaded part of the dominated plant: sc%originehaut = max(p(i+1)%hauteur(sc%AO),p(i+1)%hauteur(sc%AS)) sc%originehaut is fixed to 0 (= soil) while computing the dominated plant. Hence, the new thickness (enouv) is computed as: \\(enouv=largeur\\cdot\\left|varrapforme\\right|+hauteurzero\\), and is used to re-compute the shape of the plant: The new thickness to width ratio (raptrans, formerly varrapforme): \\(raptrans=\\frac{enouv}{largeur}\\) for rectangle shaped plants, The new width (largtrans, formerly largeur): \\(largtrans=\\frac{enouv}{varrapforme}\\) for upsided triangle shaped plants, The new width (largtrans, formerly largeur): \\(raptrans=\\frac{enouv}{largtrans}\\) for downsided triangle shaped plants, All variable names are changed, whether there is a correction or not. Here is a summary table: Table 2.1: Variable name modification in the formplante function Original Modified Definition hauteur hauteur Height largeur largtrans Width varrapforme raptrans Thickness/Width Ratio enouv enouv Thickness Upside triangle is a triangle with its base at the bottom, while downside triangle is a triangle with the base at the top. The correction of the shape of the plant can be summarised in the diagram Presented in Figure 2.2. Figure 2.2: Competition for radiation interception of the dominant plant induced by a high dominated plant The correction of the shape of the plant is only used to compute the light transmitted to a plane at the dominated plant or soil height. The targeted plant interception is computed using its whole leaf area index and a light extinction coefficient. 2.2.3 Plant height The plant height is simply computed using the plant base height, its width, and the thickness to width ratio: \\(hauteur=P_{hautbase}+largeur\\cdot\\left|varrapforme\\right|\\) So indirectly, the plant height depends on its LAI, because the plant width is computed using it in the first place. This formalism maybe not optimal, because the plant height and LAI are not well related during advanced plant physiological stages. 2.3 Light interception The light intercepted by a plant species is obtained by computing the light reaching a horizontal plane below its canopy, either at the height of the dominated plant (for the dominant plant) of the soil (for the dominated plant). Therefore, the light incident on this plane is either coming from: The incident light coming from the atmosphere, divided into two components, namely the diffuse and direct light. This light is called rdroit in the model, The light transmitted by the dominant crop, which is called rtrans, and that is generally of lower quality for photosynthesis. The effect of light quality is wrapped in the equivalent density formalism, see Chapter 5 for more details. Consequently, numerous points (20, or 200 if the inter-row is lower than 1 m) are equally distributed every meter along the inter-row (i.e. one point every 5 cm, or every 0.5 cm with 200 points), at the height of the plane. These points are used to discretize the computation of the incident light at the surface of the plane. Hence, the total number of points to simulate is computed using the interval parameter, which is equal to 200 if the inter-row is lower than 1 meter or 20 if more. It is then used to compute the total number of points to simulate as: \\(N_{points}=\\frac{ir}{2}\\cdot interval\\) In practice, the model really simulates only half of the inter-row, because it is considered that the other half have the same light conditions at daily time-scale. For example, if we take an interrow of 10 meters, the model simulates 100 points equally distributed from 0 to 5 meters. Here is an example of the X position on the plane, starting from the left-hand side of the row, using an inter-row spacing of 1 meter and a plant width of 0.2 meter: if(ir&lt;1.0){ interval = 200 }else{ interval = 20. } i= 1:(ir / 2 * interval) x= (i-1) / interval cat(paste(&quot;x=&quot;, paste(x, collapse = &quot;, &quot;))) x= 0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45 The points are then divided into two groups : The sunlit points, which are located directly under the crown of the targeted crop. The shaded points, which are not directly under the crop crown, i.e. they have the sky above them. Then the semi-hemisphere above each point is discretized onto 2 x 23 angles: 23 angles from top to right, and 23 angles from top to left. These angles are used to compute kgdiffus, the atmospheric diffuse radiation incident to the X point. However, if the X point is below the targeted crop canopy (X&lt;l/2), only the 23 angles from the top to the right are used to compute kgdiffus (considering that Xs are only computed from the left-hand plants row until the middle of the inter-row, see fig.2.3 for more details). The model determines the two angles (\\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\)) between which the point only receive incident light coming from the atmosphere (rdroit). Using these two angles (or their tangent, G), the model computes: The daily direct radiation (i.e. cumulated hourly radiation) that is incoming only during the time period between two hours (h1 and h2) when the sun angle is between \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\). Function kgeom called in rtrans. The incident diffuse radiation for all angles between \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\). Function kdiff called in rtrans. The light transmitted to the plane by the target crop for all angles below \\(\\theta_1\\) or above \\(\\theta_2\\). In practice, all points with an x position lower than \\(\\frac{largeur}{2}\\) are shaded, and all other are sunlit, so the model computes the diffuse radiation coming from the atmosphere only for one quarter of the hemisphere for shaded Xs ; the other quarter will receive transmitted light because all angles are superior to \\(\\theta_2\\). Main functions used are transrad, rtrans, kdiff and kgeom. The position of \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) (and their tangent) depends from three components: the crop shape, its inter-row spacing, and the sun azimuth (see fig. 2.3). Figure 2.3: Diagram of the computation workflow of STICS for radiation interception for two X points placed above the dominated plant species. a. The X point is considered sunlit; b. The X point is considered shaded (right under the dominant plant canopy), so only the right-hand side of the semi-hemisphere is computed for atmospheric radiation 2.3.1 Incident direct radiation from the atmosphere The incident direct radiation for each X point is computed for all angles of the hemisphere between \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) (see 2.3), and summed up to integrate the semi-hemisphere of each point. Here is an example of the computation of the direct proportion received at each X point for a crop using the kgeom() function: decangle= function(j){ theta1 = 2 * pi * (j - 80) / 365 theta2 = 0.034 * (sin(2 * pi * j / 365) - sin(2 * pi * 80 / 365)) theta = theta1 - theta2 decangle = asin(0.3978 * sin(theta)) } thetacrit= function(lat,j,tgh,alpha){ acrit = 0.0 bcrit = 0.0 a = 0.0 b = 0.0 thetacr = 0.0 hcritprec= 0 n = 3 dec = decangle(j) hprec = 0.0 pi = 4 * atan(1.0) theta= rep(0,180) for(i in 1:(18 * n)){ theta[i] = 10. / n * (i - 1) theta[i] = (theta[i] - 90) / 180 * pi # Sun position (h,azim) sinh = sin(lat) * sin(dec) + cos(lat) * cos(dec) * cos(theta[i]) h = asin(sinh) cosazim = (-cos(lat) * sin(dec) + sin(lat) * cos(dec) * cos(theta[i])) / cos(h) cosazim = pmin(1.0,cosazim) if(theta[i]!=0.0){ azim = acos(cosazim) * theta[i] / abs(theta[i]) }else{ azim = 0.0 } if(sinh&lt;0.0){h = 0.0} # Critical height hcrit = atan(tgh * abs(sin(azim + alpha + 0.00001))) # test for h = hcrit if (hcritprec &gt;= hprec &amp; hcrit &lt;= h &amp; i &gt; 1){ # Linear interpolation: acrit = (hcrit - hcritprec) / (theta[i] - theta[i-1]) bcrit = hcrit - acrit * theta[i] a = (h - hprec) / (theta[i] - theta[i-1]) b = h - a * theta[i] if(a!=acrit){thetacr = (b - bcrit) / (acrit - a)} hcritprec = hcrit hprec = h } } return(thetacr) } e = abs(l * rap) # Thickness of the plant crown xprec= 0 # Init. limite = l / 2 if(ir&lt;1.0){interval = 200.}else{interval = 20.} if(l&gt;ir/2.){l = ir/2.} if(e&gt;0.0){ limite2 = l/2 * (haut/e+1) }else{ P_forme = 1 } # NB : is it sure that it is (haut/e+1) and not (haut/(e+1)) ? # Saving some intermediate results for output here (not in the real function): x_s= (1:(ir / 2 * interval)) Output= data.frame(x_index= x_s, x_value= (x_s-1)/interval, theta1= rep(NA_real_,length(x_s)), theta2= rep(NA_real_,length(x_s)), theta1_deg= rep(NA_real_,length(x_s)), theta2_deg= rep(NA_real_,length(x_s)), kg= rep(0,length(x_s))) # Loop over Xs: for(i in x_s){ x = (i-1) / interval if(xprec&lt;=l/2&amp;x&gt;=l/2){ilim = i} xprec = x # kdir: # Rectangle: if(P_forme==1){ tgh1 = (haut + e) / (ir - x - limite) theta1 = thetacrit(lat,j,tgh1,alpha) if(x&gt;limite){ tgh2 = (haut + e) / (x - limite) theta2 = thetacrit(lat,j,tgh2,alpha) }else if(x &lt; limite){ tgh2 = haut / ( -x + limite) theta2 = -thetacrit(lat,j,tgh2,alpha) }else{ # x == limite theta2 = 0 } } # Downside Triangle: if (P_forme==2 &amp; rap&lt;0.){ tgh1 = (haut + e) / (ir - x - limite) theta1 = thetacrit(lat,j,tgh1,alpha) if (x &gt; limite){ tgh2 = (haut + e) / (x - limite) theta2 = thetacrit(lat,j,tgh2,alpha) }else if(x &lt; limite){ tgh2 = (haut + e) / ( x - limite) theta2 = -thetacrit(lat,j,tgh2,alpha) }else{ theta2 = 0 } } # Upside Triangle: if (P_forme==2&amp;rap&gt;0.){ then tgh1 = (haut + e) / (ir - x - limite) theta1 = thetacrit(lat,j,tgh1,alpha) if (x &lt; limite2){ if (x &gt; limite){ tgh2 = haut / ( x - limite) theta2 = thetacrit(lat,j,tgh2,alpha) }else if(x &lt; limite){ tgh2 = haut / (limite - x) theta2 = -thetacrit(lat,j,tgh2,alpha) }else{ theta2 = 0.0 } }else if(x &gt;= limite2){ tgh2 = (haut + e) / x theta2 = thetacrit(lat,j,tgh2,alpha) } } # NB: is there a missing else here ? kg is modified just after... if(e &gt; 2.1e-2){ kg = cos(theta1) kg = cos(theta2) } kg = 0.5 * (cos(pi/2 + theta1) + cos(pi/2 + theta2)) kg = max(kg,0.0) Output$theta1[Output$x_index==i]= theta1 Output$theta2[Output$x_index==i]= theta2 Output$kg[Output$x_index==i]= kg } Output$theta1_deg= (pi/2+Output$theta1)*180/pi Output$theta2_deg= (pi/2-Output$theta2)*180/pi colnames(Output)= c(&quot;X index&quot;,&quot;X value (m)&quot;,&quot;Theta 1 (rad)&quot;,&quot;Theta 2 (rad)&quot;, &quot;Theta 1 (deg)&quot;,&quot;Theta 2 (deg)&quot;,&quot;kgdirect&quot;) kable(Output, caption= paste(&quot;Example of the computation of the incident direct&quot;, &quot;radiation ratio kgdirect.

In the model, \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) are computed in radian relative to the vertical plane above X. To provide a simpler representation, \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) are also given in degrees relative to the horizontal plane (i.e. soil or dominated plant species surface) in tab.2.2. 2.3.2 Incident diffuse radiation from the atmosphere The incident diffuse radiation for all angles between \\(\\theta_1\\) and \\(\\theta_2\\) is computed using G, the apparent tangent to the considered \\(\\theta\\). First the model computes it for \\(\\theta_1\\), and uses it as a threshold under which no diffuse radiation comes from the atmosphere because only transmitted radiation reaches this angle for the considered X point. Second, the model tests if the X point is below the target crop canopy, and if not it computes G for \\(\\theta_2\\), and applies the same methodology, with G being the upper threshold this time. This method avoids computing the left-hand quarter of the hemisphere since it receives only transmitted light necessarily if it is under the targeted crop. Here is an example of the computation of the diffuse proportion received at each X point for the same crop as above (interrow= 1 meter, width= 0.2 meter, thickness= 0.1 meter, height= 1 meter) using the kdif() function: # Initializations: htab= c(9.23, 9.23, 9.23, 9.23, 9.23, 10.81, 10.81, 26.57, 26.57, 26.57, 31.08, 31.08, 31.08, 31.08, 31.08, 47.41, 47.41, 47.41, 52.62, 52.62, 69.16, 69.16, 69.16) aztab= c(12.23,59.77,84.23,131.77,156.23,36,108,0,72,144,23.27,48.73,95.27, 120.73,167.27,0,72,144,36,108,0,72,144) SOCtab= c(0.0043, 0.0043, 0.0043, 0.0043, 0.0043, 0.0055, 0.0055, 0.0140, 0.0140, 0.0140, 0.0197, 0.0197, 0.0197, 0.0197, 0.0197, 0.0336, 0.0336, 0.0336, 0.0399, 0.0399, 0.0495, 0.0495, 0.0495) xprec= 0 if(ir&lt;1.0){interval = 200.}else{interval = 20.} if(l&gt;ir/2.){l = ir/2.} # Saving some intermediate results for Output_diff here (not in the real function): x_s= (1:(ir / 2 * interval)) Output_diff= data.frame(x_index= rep(x_s,each=23), x_value= rep((x_s-1)/interval,each=23), Angle = rep(1:23, length(x_s)), G1= rep(NA_real_,length(x_s)*23), G2= rep(NA_real_,length(x_s)*23), hcrit= rep(0,length(x_s)*23), kgdiffus= rep(0,length(x_s)*23)) # Loop over Xs: for(i in x_s){ x = (i-1) / interval if(xprec&lt;=l/2&amp;x&gt;=l/2){ilim = i} xprec = x # kdif: x = min(x,ir/2) e = abs(l*rap) kgdiffus = 0. # Computing for the right-hand of the row: G1 = (haut+e)/(ir-x-l/2.) # the apparent tangent h1 for(j in 1:23){ hcrit = atan(G1*sin(aztab[j]/180*pi))/pi*180 if(hcrit&lt;htab[j]){ kgdiffus = kgdiffus+SOCtab[j] ######## Not in the real function ######## Output_diff$kgdiffus[Output_diff$x_index==i&amp;Output_diff$Angle==j]= SOCtab[j] ########################################## } ######## Not in the real function ######## Output_diff$hcrit[Output_diff$x_index==i&amp;Output_diff$Angle==j]= hcrit Output_diff$G1[Output_diff$x_index==i&amp;Output_diff$Angle==j]= G1 ########################################## } # Computing for the left-hand row, if the point is not a shaded point: if(x&gt;l/2){ G2 = (haut+e)/(x-l/2) # the apparent tangent h2 for(j in 1:23){ hcrit = atan(G2*sin(aztab[j]/180*pi))/pi*180 if(hcrit &lt; htab[j]){ kgdiffus = kgdiffus+SOCtab[j] ######## Not in the real function ######## Output_diff$kgdiffus[Output_diff$x_index==i&amp;Output_diff$Angle==j]= Output_diff$kgdiffus[Output_diff$x_index==i&amp;Output_diff$Angle==j]+SOCtab[j] ########################################## } ######## Not in the real function ######## Output_diff$hcrit[Output_diff$x_index==i&amp;Output_diff$Angle==j]= hcrit Output_diff$G2[Output_diff$x_index==i&amp;Output_diff$Angle==j]= G2 ########################################## } } } colnames(Output_diff)= c(&quot;X index&quot;,&quot;X value (m)&quot;,&quot;angle&quot;,&quot;G1 (tangent)&quot;, &quot;G2 (tangent)&quot;,&quot;hcrit&quot;,&quot;kgdiffus&quot;) if(knitr:::pandoc_to() == &quot;html&quot;) {Output_diff}else{ kable(Output_diff[1:10,], caption = paste(&quot;Computation of the diffuse light incident on each&quot;, &quot;point x.

Taking our previous example again, this computation leads to: rdirect= 1-rdif rdroit= (Output_diff$kgdiffus*rdif)+(Output$kg*rdirect) rtransmis = (1.0 - rdroit) * (exp(-P_ktrou * (lai + eai))) incident_light= data.frame(Output[,1:2],Total=rdroit+rtransmis, rdroit= rdroit, rtransmis= rtransmis, light_env= ifelse(Output$`X value (m)`&lt;limite,&quot;Shaded&quot;,&quot;Sunlit&quot;)) kable(incident_light, col.names = c(&quot;X index&quot;,&quot;X value (m)&quot;,&quot;Total incident ratio&quot;, &quot;Atmospheric ratio (rdroit)&quot;,&quot;Transmitted ratio (rtransmis)&quot;, &quot;Light environment&quot;), caption=paste(&quot;Example of the computation of the total incident radiation ratio.&quot;, &quot;See introduction section for further details on the crop.&quot;)) Table 2.4: Example of the computation of the total incident radiation ratio.

It is the proportion of the incident ligth from the atmosphere that reach the point on the plane below the plant canopy. This light either comes directly from the sky (rdroit) or passing through the plant canopy (rtransmis). Consequently, the first point X of our example that is right under the plant canopy receives in average 77.2720162% of the light coming from the atmosphere: 31.0604617% of the light directly from the sky (either direct or diffuse light) + 46.2115545% of the light that is transmitted by the plant above. 2.3.6 Total radiation incident to the plane After computing the total incident ratio for each point, the model averages the values between the so-called sunlit and shaded components. Each point positioned right under the plant canopy is considered shaded, and all other is considered sunlit (see fig. 2.3). using our previous example, this computation gives: incident_light%&lt;&gt;% group_by(light_env)%&gt;% summarise(Total= mean(Total))%&gt;% transmute(Variable= c(&quot;rombre&quot;,&quot;rsoleil&quot;),light_env,Total) kable(incident_light, col.names = c(&quot;STICS variable name&quot;,&quot;Light environment&quot;, &quot;Total incident light ratio&quot;), caption= paste(&quot;Example of the computation of the total incident radiation&quot;, &quot;ratio for each light environment for a horizontal plane below&quot;, &quot;the targeted plant canopy.

STICS variable name Light environment Total incident light ratio rombre Shaded 0.7755858 rsoleil Sunlit 0.7943134 Finally, both ratios are used to compute the intercepted PAR raint (MJ m-2 d-1) of the target plant as: \\(raint=P_{parsurrg}\\cdot trg\\cdot(1-(rombre\\cdot surfAO)-(rsoleil\\cdot surfAS))\\) where \\(P_{parsurrg}\\) is a coefficient to compute PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) from the global radiation, trg is the active radiation (either global radiation or radiation transmitted below the dominant crop), rombre and rsoleil are the ratio of incident light for shaded and sunlit components of the plane, and surfAO and surfAS are the relative surfaces (0 to 1) of the shaded and sunlit components of the plane. The computation of trg is further described in Chapter 3. library(tidyverse) library(magrittr) P_parsurrg= 0.5 incident_light%&lt;&gt;%spread(light_env,Total) surfAO = l/ir surfAO = min(surfAO,1.0) surfAS = 1.0 - surfAO raint = P_parsurrg * trg * (1 - (incident_light$Shaded[1] * surfAO) - (incident_light$Sunlit[2]* surfAS)) For our example, the crop would have intercepted 2.62 MJ m-2 day-1 of radiation, with a PAR of 12.5 W m-2, an rombre of 0.7755858, an rsoleil of 0.7943134 and a relative surface of 0.2 and 0.8 for the shaded and sunlit component respectively. The relative surfaces (0 to 1) of the shaded and sunlit components of the plane (surfAO and surfAS) that are computed during the dominant plant computation are then used as the shaded and sunlit surfaces for the dominated plant. 2.4 Summary The interception of the targeted plant is obtained by: Computing the light that is incident at a horizontal plane at the height of the dominated plant (or the soil) and, Substracting this incident light to the global PAR, which gives the PAR intercepted by the target plant. This process is applied iteratively to the dominant and the dominated plant to compute both species PAR interception while taking account for their respective structure (shape, height, width…). 2.5 Discussion and proposed modifications The dominated plant interception is computed in two separate computations, one for the sunlit component, and one for the shaded component, and interception is then weighted by their relative surface. The dominant plant is considered having 100% of its surface that is sunlit, so all this computation is made only for its sunlit part. The radiation above the dominant plant (trg) is the global radiation, but the radiation above the dominated plant (also trg) is computed as: \\(trg=trg\\cdot rsoleil\\) where rsoleil is the average proportion of light intercepted by the sunlit area of the plane below the dominant plant. This computation is only right for the sunlit component of the dominated plant. A modification is proposed, discussed and tested on Chapter 3. "],

This computation does not consider that the average proportion of light incident above the shaded part of the dominated plant (rombre) is different from rsoleil. See Chapter 2 for more details. 3.2 Proposed solution We propose to change this computation to take the relevant incident light according to the light regime of the dominated plant under computation: if(i &gt; 1) then if(ens.eq.sc%AS) then c%trg(n) = trg_bak * p(i-1)%rsoleil else c%trg(n) = trg_bak * p(i-1)%rombre endif endif With this new computation, the radiation incident above the dominated plant depends from the component under consideration (shaded or sunlit), and is computed using the geometry of the dominant plant (for atmospheric+transmitted light computation). 3.3 Results A comparison of the two was made using the sticRs package, from which a summary plot was extracted. The results are shown in Figure 3.1. Figure 3.1: trg comparison The comparison between both indicated that the dominated plant intercepted more PAR with the original computation (raint), due to its wrong light regime (rsoleil for both AS and AO). While the dry mass and height of the dominated plant did not change, its LAI was previously higher on the end of the rotation, which increased the rsoleil and rombre of the ground (visible as associated ones). These simulations also showed that the wheat (dominant) eai was highly overestimated, which will be fixed in the next simulations. "],

This surface is computed using the fruit dry mass (maenfruit) and a parameter (P_sea) as follow: \\(eai=P_{sea}\\cdot\\frac{maenfruit}{100}\\) This parameter was originally equal to 100, meaning that each gram of fruit dry mass gave 1 m2 of equivalent LAI. This value was probably overestimated, but before re-parameterizing the plant, we first needed to know the model sensitivity to this parameter. 4.2 Model sensitivity to the P_sea parameter The model sensitivity was assessed using the sticRs package using values from 10 to 90 for the P_sea parameter. The results are shown below (see html version of this book for interactivity): sea_sensi= sticRs::load_sensi(dirpath = &quot;data/sea_sensitivity&quot;) if(knitr:::pandoc_to() == &quot;html&quot;) { gg_objects= lapply(sea_sensi$gg_objects, function(x){ plotly::ggplotly(x, tooltip= &quot;group&quot;) }) htmltools::tagList(gg_objects) }else{ multiplot(plotlist = sea_sensi$gg_objects) } The results show that the higher the P_sea, the higher the eai, and hence increasing the light interception (raint), which induced a higher aboveground dry mass (masec). The plant LAI is not influenced by the P_sea though, because there is no retroactions on this variable. In the case of intercrops, the P_sea parameter can influence the dominated plant also, because less light is transmitted when P_sea is high : sea_sensi_IC= sticRs::load_sensi(dirpath = &quot;data/SEA_IC_Wheat_Pea&quot;) if(knitr:::pandoc_to() == &quot;html&quot;) { gg_objects= plotly::ggplotly(sea_sensi_IC$gg_objects$raint, tooltip= &quot;group&quot;) htmltools::tagList(gg_objects) }else{ print(sea_sensi_IC$gg_objects$raint) } The other variables are not much impacted though: multiplot(plotlist = sea_sensi_IC$gg_objects[ -grep(&quot;raint&quot;, names(sea_sensi_IC$gg_objects))]) 4.3 Parameterization of the P_sea parameter Knowing that the key outputs from the model are not much impacted by the P_sea parameter as soon as its value is not unreasonable, we tested several values of the parameter (i.e. 20, 50 and 80) and compared the outputs of the model against measurements for several types of management: Wheat in sole crop, Pea in sole crop, Wheat in self-intercrop, Pea in self-intercrop, and a Wheat-Pea intercrop.

["plantdensity.html", "Chapter 5 Plant density and equivalent plant density 5.1 Introduction 5.2 The density effect on LAI 5.3 The equivalent density 5.4 Proposition for new equivalent density formalism", " Chapter 5 Plant density and equivalent plant density 5.1 Introduction The plant density, which is related to the interrow distance, seems to be an important formalism to describe the crop, and particularly for mixed crops. Several computations are made to represent plant competition in the STICS model, making the density effect a complex process. Lets describe each step of the process to have a clearer representation in mind. 5.2 The density effect on LAI In the model, the plant density is taken as a negative effect upon the LAI growth as soon as a threshold of LAI is reached. This threshold (P_laicomp) represents the moment when the leaf surface of a plant start becoming competitive for light against another plant (from the same species or not). So whenever the LAI is higher than P_laicomp, the effect of the density (efdensite) become closer to 0 (the effect is null when equal to 1, and maximum at 0). This effect is computed as: \\(ef_{densite}=\\min\\left\\{1.0\\ ;\\ e^{P_{adens}\\cdot\\frac{log(densiteequiv)}{P_{bdens}}}\\right\\}\\) or more simply: \\(ef_{densite}=\\min\\left\\{1.0\\ ;\\ (\\frac{densiteequiv}{P_{bdens}})^{P_{adens}}\\right\\}\\) Replace the equation in the model to simplify too ? Here is a plot representing the density effect along the equivalent density: library(tidyverse) expand.grid(densiteequiv= 140:280, P_adens=c(-0.54,-0.7),P_bdens=c(7,10))%&gt;% transmute(Parameters= paste(&quot;P_adens=&quot;,P_adens,&quot;P_bdens=&quot;,P_bdens, sep=&quot;, &quot;), densiteequiv, efdensite= pmin(1.0,(exp(P_adens * (log(densiteequiv/P_bdens))))))%&gt;% arrange(Parameters)%&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=densiteequiv))+ geom_point(aes(y=efdensite,colour= Parameters))+ labs(x= &quot;Equivalent density&quot;, y= &quot;Density effect (0-1)&quot;, colour= &quot;a and b parameters values&quot;, title=&quot;Equivalent density / density effect&quot;) So the higher the density, the higher the negative effect on LAI. 5.3 The equivalent density In sole crops, the density effect is straightforward. However, under the case of mixed crops, the density effect can be higher for the dominated plant compared to its equivalent in sole crops. Indeed, a pea in sole crop would have a given competition with other close plants, but a different one when mixed with wheat, where the same density of wheat can give higher competition effect for light because it is taller. Then the density effect is computed as an equivalent density instead (densiteequiv), that can differ from the sowing density for the dominated crop to increase the negative effect of efdensite compared to a sole crop. The previous implementation in STICS was simple. As soon as a plant become dominated, it had an increased equivalent density compared to its actual density (e.g. doubled). After some discussion with the STICS intercrop team, this formalism was considered not suitable for two reasons: Whenever a plant become shorter its density drastically increases regardless of the height difference. We propose to modify the formalism to consider the height difference explicitly while computing the equivalent density. For the moment, the competition induced by the density of the other species (i.e. interspecies competition) was re-included in the equivalent density computation using the P_bdensp1 and P_bdensp2 parameters, which come from the sole crop formalism, where it is used to consider intra-species competition effect. The equivalent density was originally set up to consider the decrease in light quality when a plant has another plant above it. Adding another computation of competition based on the density of the other plant could be redundant, because it is already considered during the light interception (see Chapter 6 and 2). Consequently, we propose to remove this computation from the equivalent density formalism, and to let the P_bdensp1 and P_bdensp2 parameters being used to compute the efdensite variable only. 5.4 Proposition for new equivalent density formalism 5.4.1 Definition of the different propositions The user will now have four options to compute the equivalent density, depending on the value of the P_code_calc_equi_density parameter: (1): Previous computation : \\(density_{Equivalent}= density_{p2} + \\frac{density_{p1}}{P_{bdensp1}}\\cdot P_{bdensp2}\\) (2): Improved computation to define the equivalent density as a function of the height difference between the plants as follow: \\(density_{Equivalent} =\\begin{cases}\\Delta_{height} &gt; hauteur_{threshold} &amp; density_{p2} + \\frac{density_{p1}}{P_{bdensp1}}\\cdot P_{bdensp2} \\\\ \\Delta_{height} &lt; hauteur_{threshold} &amp; density_{p2}+slope\\cdot abs\\left|\\Delta_{height}\\right| \\end{cases}\\) with \\(diffx= \\frac{density_{p1}}{P_{bdensp1}}\\cdot P_{bdensp2}\\) and \\(slope= \\frac{diffx}{hauteur_{threshold}}\\) (3): Improved computation to define the equivalent density as a function of the height difference between the plants, and using different parameters for intraspecific and interspecific competition, with simpler meanings. This formalism would give no increase in equivalent density until a given threshold (hauteur_threshold), after which a progressive increase in the equivalent density would happen until the maximum allowed. In this computation, the slope would be computed by the model, and the equivalent density would be computed as follows: \\(density_{Equivalent} =\\begin{cases}\\Delta_{height} &lt; hauteur_{threshold} &amp; density_{p2} \\\\ \\Delta_{height} &gt; hauteur_{threshold} &amp; b + \\Delta_{height}\\cdot slope \\\\ \\Delta_{height} &gt; hauteur_{threshold_2} &amp; Max_{equDens} \\end{cases}\\) with \\(slope= \\frac{Max_{equDens}}{hauteur_{threshold_2}-hauteur_{threshold}}\\). This formalism would include three parameters: hauteur_threshold: the difference in height below which no competition is occuring hauteur_threshold_2: the difference in height below which a progressive competition is occuring Max_equDens: the maximum equivalent density allowed (generally the sole crop density). Any other value: the equivalent density is equal to the true plant density 5.4.2 Visual representation of the options The two new formalisms are both linking the equivalent density to the difference of height between the two plants, but using different parameters and outputs. df_DE= data.frame(Delta_height= seq(from= 0.01, to= 1, by= 0.01)) density_p1= 140 density_p2= 30 P_bdensp1= 7 ; P_bdensp2= 1.5 hauteur_threshold= 0.2 diffx = density_p1 / P_bdensp1 * P_bdensp2 slope= diffx/hauteur_threshold Here is a visual representation of the equivalent density when P_code_calc_equi_density= 2 for a wheat-pea intercrop with a plant density of 140 for the wheat as the principal species and 30 for the pea as the associated species: df_DE%&gt;% mutate(Equ_density= ifelse(Delta_height&gt;hauteur_threshold, density_p2 + density_p1/P_bdensp1 *P_bdensp2, density_p2+slope*abs(Delta_height)) )%&gt;% ggplot(aes(y= Equ_density, x= Delta_height, colour=Equ_density))+ geom_point()+ labs(colour = &quot;Equivalent density&quot;, x = &quot;Delta height (Dominant Plant Height-Dominated Plant Height)&quot;, y= &quot;Dominated plant equivalent density&quot;, title= &quot;New formalism for equivalent plant density&quot;) This option has several implications in the model, notably that the dominated plant is less impacted by the competition with the dominant plant when both have approximately the same height. Here is a visual representation of the same output when P_code_calc_equi_density= 3: df_DE= data.frame(Delta_height= seq(from= 0.01, to= 1, by= 0.01)) hauteur_threshold_2= 0.8 Max_equDens= 60 slope= (Max_equDens)/(hauteur_threshold_2-hauteur_threshold) b= density_p2-slope*hauteur_threshold df_DE%&gt;% mutate(slope= (Max_equDens)/(hauteur_threshold_2-hauteur_threshold), Equ_density= ifelse(Delta_height&gt;hauteur_threshold, slope*abs(Delta_height)+b,density_p2))%&gt;% mutate(Equ_density= ifelse(Equ_density&gt;Max_equDens, Max_equDens,Equ_density))%&gt;% ggplot(aes(y= Equ_density, x= Delta_height, colour=Equ_density))+ geom_point()+ labs(colour = &quot;Equivalent density&quot;, x = &quot;Delta height (Dominant Plant Height-Dominated Plant Height)&quot;, y= &quot;Dominated plant equivalent density&quot;, title= &quot;New (third) formalism for equivalent plant density&quot;) This formalism considers no interspecific competition for the quality of light while the difference in height is low, and then an increased competition until a maximum is reached. 5.4.3 Comparison between options A comparison of the different formalisms was made using the sticRs package, from which a summary plot was extracted, and the results are shown in Figure 5.1. Figure 5.1: Comparing options for the equivalent density computation It is not very clear from the figure, but the second and third options (i.e. P_code_calc_equi_density= 2 and P_code_calc_equi_density= 3) for the equivalent density computation are both less severe than the previous one (P_code_calc_equi_density= 1) for the dominated plant. The second one has effect on the equivalent effect for limited time only (dashed red curve), while the third one show no increase in equivalent density all along the crop life because the height difference remains below the first threshold. Consequently, the dominated plant intercepts more light (see cumraint and fapar) and has a higher LAI using the third option. "],
["Interrow.html", "Chapter 6 Interrow spacing 6.1 Introduction 6.2 Inter-row spacing for mixed crops in the model", " Chapter 6 Interrow spacing 6.1 Introduction The inter-row is the distance between two rows of the same plant species. Figure 6.1 shows a simple design with a field with two plant species sowed with the same inter-row. Figure 6.1: Pea-Wheat intercrop using the same inter-row spacing for the two crops So far, so good. Now what happens if we set a different inter-row spacing for the two species ? 6.2 Inter-row spacing for mixed crops in the model Whereas the model as a notion of the position of the plants along the interrow considering the same plant species (i.e. Principal or Associated), it does not explicitly position the different plant species between each other. Indeed, the light interception of the dominant plant is first computed using its geometry and a plane at the height of the dominated plant. Then, the light interception of the dominated plant is computed using the average light incident on the previous plane (separated between shaded and sunlit component), the plant geometry, and a second plane right above the soil. So when computing its light interception, the dominated plant do not consider at all the dominant plant interrow spacing, but only the light it transmits. Of course the dominant plant interrow spacing does impact the light that is transmitted to the dominatd plant, but it is not an explicit description of the interrow spacing. Figure 6.2 shows a depiction of how the model describe the interrow for intercrops. Figure 6.2: Interrow effect on light interception for intercrops in the STICS model The model does effectively compute half the interrow light interception only, because it is assumed that the other half have the same light regime at daily time-scale. First the interrow of the dominant plant is used to position the left and right dominant plants. The model then computes the golbal radiation (trg) that is transmitted to the Plane 1, which is then used to compute the light intercepted by the dominant plant. The light transmitted to the Plane 1 is divided into two light regimes: a shaded component (surface right under the dominant plant canopy) and a sunlit component (the opposite). Second, the light incident on the Plane 1 is used as the trg for the dominated plant, and the same computation than for the dominant plant is performed for the shaded and sunlit components of the dominated plant, and then integrated at species-scale using both light interception and relative surface. To conclude on this point, we see that the interrow spacing can only impact the light interception as a density effect (more plants per m2, closer intra-species canopy), but not as a pure geometrical effect. For more details on how the trg is computed, see Chapter 3, and for more details on light interception, see Chapter 2. "],

Figure 8.1: Leaf Area Index in a self-intercrop of Wheat-Wheat This issue can have different origins. The main hypothesis are: The leaf surface may be too high compared to their mass, coming from an abnormally high sla A too low senescence, coming itself from a too long leaf lifespan, which could arise from a too low nitrogen mobilization (increase the lifespan), and/or a too low water stress (water stress can decrease the life span). 8.2 Investigating the sla hypothesis Figure 8.2 shows that both plants (i.e. Principal and Associated) have exactly the same SLA during the growing cycle. This discard the possibility of a problem coming from a wrong SLA because it would be much higher for the plant with the constant LAI at the end of the cycle. Figure 8.2: Specific Leaf Area in a self-intercrop of Wheat-Wheat 8.3 Leaf senescence Leaf senescence is actually much lower for the plant that has a non-decreasing LAI (Figure 8.3) Figure 8.3: Leaf Senescence in a self-intercrop of Wheat-Wheat The next step is to find out why leaf senescence is too low for this plant. 8.3.1 Leaf lifespan The Figure 8.4 shows that the leaf lifespan is not much different between both plants either, rejecting our hypothesis of a too long lifespan. Figure 8.4: Leaf Lifespan in a self-intercrop of Wheat-Wheat However, printing the lifespan for each light environment (i.e. shaded, sunlit) showed that the lifespan of the shaded part of the dominated plant was equal to 0 most of the time, making nsencours jump from nlev to the first day when senescence is computed (here at day 208) at once (Figure 8.5). Figure 8.5: Leaf (lai) appearence day (nsencour) compared to the day (day) they become senescent (self-intercrop of Wheat-Wheat) The leaf lifespan (durvie(i)) was computed as: if (i &lt; fin) then durvie(i) = min(durvie(i), durage * min(senstress, fstressgel)) else durvie(i) = durage * min(senstress, fstressgel) endif The bug came from the computation of durvie(i) that was initialized to 0, and always equal to 0 afterward until the fin was reached. A correction is proposed to fix the bug, which make the same computation except on the first day on which the senescence is computed (nsencour==nlev): if (i &lt; fin .and. nsencour &gt; nlev) then durvie(i) = min(durvie(i), durage * min(senstress, fstressgel)) else durvie(i) = durage * min(senstress, fstressgel) endif The new computation fix the bug, making nsencour more progressive as for the dominant plant (Figure 8.6). Figure 8.6: Leaf (lai) appearence day (nsencour) compared to the day (day) they become senescent using the new computation of durvie (self-intercrop of Wheat-Wheat) 8.3.2 Stress indices The senescence is computed using leaf life span, but also two different stress indices: senfac for the water stress and innsenes for the nitrogen stress. Figure 8.7 shows that the plant with non-decreasing LAI has a higher stress compared with the other plant, rejecting again the hypothesis of a too low stress indices. Figure 8.7: Stress index to compute leaf lifespan in a self-intercrop of Wheat-Wheat 8.3.3 Over-fertilization The problem could arise from a nitrogen over-fertilization (inn) that could increase lifespan, but the Figure 8.8 shows the contrary, with a lower inn for the plant with non-decreasing LAI. Figure 8.8: Nitrogen over-fertilization in a self-intercrop of Wheat-Wheat 8.3.4 De-activating water and nitrogen stresses To check if the senescence is still related to water and nitrogen stresses, Figure 8.9 shows a simulation where both effects are removed (P_codeh2oact= 2 and P_codeinnact= 2). Figure 8.9: Simulation of a Wheat-Wheat self-intercrop with no nitrogen and water stresses Removing the stress do not change the fact that one plant has a constant LAI at the end of the crop cycle. This proves that the problem does not arise from a limitation in water or nitrogen. 8.4 The solution to the first issue Three main variables were badly used to compute the senescence: dltams, deltai and pfeuilverte. These variables correspond to the daily increment in dry mass, daily increment in lai, and the green leaves proportion. The model used the values from previous computations kept in memory to compute the different components of the senescence for each light environment of the plant (i.e. sunlit or shaded) separately. Unfortunately, the dominance of the plant can change over time, so a dominant plant with no shaded component can have one afterwards. If a dominant plant becomes dominated, the model was trying to use dltams, deltai and pfeuilverte of the shaded part of the plant that all were equal to 0 (as their initialization) because they were not computed before, making no senescence at all for the shaded part of the plant. We propose to replace the use of a separated shaded and sunlit dltams, deltai and pfeuilverte by a their total at plant level, weighted by their relative surface under shaded and sunlit environment. For example, the deltai input to the senescen function would be p(i)%deltai(0,1:sc%nbjmax)*p(i)%surf(ens) instead of p(i)%deltai(ens,1:sc%nbjmax)), with p(i)%deltai(0,n) = p(i)%deltai(sc%AS,n)* p(i)%surf(sc%AS) + p(i)%deltai(sc%AO,n)* p(i)%surf(sc%AO). This new computation has the advantage of considering all the lai that was incremented before, with a drawback being not to consider the previous relative surface of the plant. Figure 8.10 shows the resulting outputs, which are more realistic. Figure 8.10: Simulation of a Wheat-Wheat self-intercrop leaf area index using the modified STICS version 8.5 Fixing a second issue After adressing the first issue, I added the new formalism to compute the equivalent density (see Chapter 5). While studying the effect of this new formalism, I stumbled upon the same apparent issue : the lai was not decreasing at the end of the crop cycle. This issue came from the fact that the sharing of the deltai for the dominated plant between the shaded and sunlit components was too simple (see previous paragraph). Indeed, the deltai was weighted according to their respective surface of the current day (n), but the senescence can happen on different days (and it is) because both light components do not experience the same temperature conditions, so the surface effectively used to wheight deltai can be different from one day to another, making either the total dominated plant deltai too high or too low, as seen in Figure 8.11, which shows an lai that do not go down to 0 at the end of the crop cycle. Figure 8.11: Simulation of a Wheat-Wheat self-intercrop using STICS showing an issue in the simulation of the lai at the end of the crop cycle The issue was partially fixed by adding a temporary variable (deltai_sencour) to keep trace of how much and when the senescent lai was created, to remove it from the overall pool (new variable, deltai_tmp) used by the shaded component afterwards. The simulations outputs using the modified STICS are visible in Figure 8.12. Figure 8.12: Partially fixed issue in the simulation of the lai at the end of the crop cycle This same issue was also found happening for the senescent mass, and the code was modified accordingly to correct it. However, the problem is not entirely solved, because the lai and mafeuilleverte are not going down to 0 at the end of the crop cycle yet. This came from the way the model compute the cumulative sunlit and shaded deltai, dltaisen, dltams and pfeuilverte at the plant level that is not compatible with their new computation anymore, because theiy already are weighted for plant level. For example, we computed dltaisenas : p%dltaisen(0) = p%dltaisen(sc%AS) * p%surf(sc%AS) + p%dltaisen(sc%AO) * p%surf(sc%AO) So now it is simply computed as: p%dltaisen(0) = p%dltaisen(sc%AS) + p%dltaisen(sc%AO) Figure 8.13 shows the results given by the modified STICS, which finally gives a lai and a mafeuilleverte equal to 0 at the end of the cycle.

["FAPARissue.html", "Chapter 9 Issue on FaPAR greater than one 9.1 Introduction 9.2 The solution to the problem", " Chapter 9 Issue on FaPAR greater than one 9.1 Introduction The fraction of absorbed PAR (fapar) should have values between 0 (no absorption) and 1 (full absorption). The STICS model computed values greater than 1 sometimes (Figure 9.1), which is problematic. Figure 9.1: Leaf Area Index in a self-intercrop of Wheat-Wheat 9.2 The solution to the problem The fapar is computed in the raytrans subroutine, which only uses the PAR transmitted by the dominant plant to a plane above the dominated plant components. This PAR has lower values compared to the atmospheric PAR (i.e. from the sky), leading to greater fapar. We propose to recompute the fapar after the biomaer subroutine to use the atmospheric PAR instead, which is what the user would expect. The new fapar is now computed as p(i)%fapar(ens)= p(i)%raint(ens) / (trg_bak * pg%P_parsurrg), and gives better results (Figure 9.2).

["height.html", "Chapter 10 Computing plant height 10.1 Introduction 10.2 Link between height and lai and dry mass 10.3 Computing plant height", " Chapter 10 Computing plant height 10.1 Introduction Plant height is not very well simulated for the moment. It is computated using the plant width, which depends itself on the plant lai (lai+eai+laisen). Please see Chapter 2 for more details. Figure 10.1 shows the simulated height of wheat in Auzeville, and the variables from which it is computed. Figure 10.1: Simulated height compared to the observed values, and variables from which it is computed from, in a self-intercrop of Wheat-Wheat The plant height is important in the case of intercrops because it has high impact on the light interception of both species. Indeed, a sensitivity analysis was performed using the sticRs package on the parameter that links the lai to the height: P_rapforme. The results are shown below (see html version of this book for interactivity): height_sensi= sticRs::load_sensi(dirpath = &quot;data/rapforme_sensitivity&quot;) if(knitr:::pandoc_to() == &quot;html&quot;) { gg_objects= lapply(height_sensi$gg_objects, function(x){ plotly::ggplotly(x, tooltip= &quot;group&quot;) }) htmltools::tagList(gg_objects) }else{ multiplot(plotlist = height_sensi$gg_objects) } As we can see on the above plots, as the plant height is affected, its lai is also impacted afterwards. We can also see that no values of P_rapforme gave satisfactory plant height, so maybe the link between the plant lai and the plant height is not as straightforward as previously thought, and maybe there is another variable that could be better correlated to it. 10.2 Link between height and lai and dry mass Using the observations from Auzeville, we plotted the evolution of the plant height through time along the lai and the masec (i.e. dry mass) to see if and how they are correlated. The Figure 10.2 shows this evolution with standardized and linearly interpolated observed values for all variables to make it easier to compare. Figure 10.2: Observed plant height compared to the lai and dry mass for both wheat and pea in sole crop. The Figure 10.2 shows that the plant height is better correlated to the masec than to the lai. We propose to either use the masec or somcour to compute it rather than the lai. 10.3 Computing plant height 10.3.1 Observations The plant height could be computed by either using the plant dry mass (masec) or more simply the development stage, derived from cumulated degree days (somcour). The second method could be much simpler to parameterize from field, however, both plants experience the same microclimate in STICS for intercrops, so a plant growing dominated by an another plant could have the same cumulative temperature than a plant in sunlit conditions. Hence, this method would not consider the competition effect in interspecies for height, so it cannot be implemented as long as both plants have the same somcour. To document further this phenomenon, Figure 10.3 shows that a Pea grown in intercrop with a wheat has a lower height than a Pea grown in solecrop, and that the dry mass is a good proxy to predict this behaviour. Figure 10.3: Observed Pea height and dry mass for a Pea grown in sole crop or in intercrop with wheat. Hence, we will implement a computation of the plant height using the plant dry mass (masec). 10.3.2 Stresses Water and nitrogen stresses can both influence the height of a plant. Figure 10.4 shows that the maximum height is reduced for the wheat grown under nitrogen stress (i.e. no nitrogen feritilization). However, the height and massec relationship are very close for both management, only the dry mass is higher for fertilized wheat, which gives a higher height in the end. Figure 10.4: Observed relationship between height and dry mass for a wheat grown in sole crop. Consequently, height is indeed influenced by nitrogen stress, but it appears from our data that it is only through the height~masen_n relationship. Conequently, the height computation shouldn’t be corrected by any nitrogen indices, because this stress is already accounted for in the dry mass computation. 10.3.3 Computation The new computation is implemented in STICS as a new subroutine (formplante_mas) that is called instead of formplante if the newly defined P_code_shape parameter is equal to 2. This subroutine is largely based on the previous one, conserving all side effects of P_hautmax, P_hautmaxtec, P_largtec and originehaut but add a computation of the plant height using an allometric relationship with the dry mass as follow : $ hauteur= P_{hautbase} + P_{hautK} masec^{P_{hautA}}$ The P_hautbase parameter is a parameter from formplante, and is used as the intercept of the relationship, i.e the base height when the dry mass is equal to 0. P_hautK is a new parameter that defines the constant of proportionality that reflects the importance of the relationship, and P_hautA the scaling exponent, or the allometric coefficient. Allometric relationships are simple yet powerfull laws used to describe diverse relationships for wide range of situations. Further documentation can be found on the wikipedia webpage. 10.3.4 Results Two simulations of a wheat in sole crop and a pea in sole crop were run using STICS to asses the potential of the new computation for height modelling, and the outputs are displayed in Figure 10.5. Figure 10.5: STICS simulation output for a simulation on two sole crops: wheat and pea The results show that using masec instead of the lai to model plant height gives better results. The model will now be used with this formalism. "],

Figure 11.1: Development stages as measured in Auzeville The STICS simulations are not in adequation with these results for the moment. 11.2 Checking the ilev The date of emergence is set using the ilev parameter. This parameter had a value of 380 in the STICS input files. read_param(dirpath = &quot;0-DATA/Source_data/USMs/IC_Wheat_Wheat&quot;, param = &quot;ilev&quot;) # 380 The Fig. 3 of Bedoussac (2009) shows that ilev should occur 151 cumulated Celsius degrees per day after sewing, but a simple computation showed us that this conditions is met on the 329th day already, and not on the 380th as previously parameterized (see computation below). # Extracting the day of sewing: day_sewing= read_param(dirpath = &quot;0-DATA/Source_data/USMs/IC_Wheat_Wheat&quot;, param = &quot;iplt&quot;)%&gt;% as.numeric()%&gt;%.[1] # 311th day of the year 2005. # Reading the meteo file: met= read_met(&quot;0-DATA/Source_data/USMs/IC_Wheat_Wheat&quot;) # Computing the day on which ilev should occur, i.e. at least 151 cumulated # Celsius degrees per day after sewing: met$d_jul= as.numeric(format(met$Date, &quot;%j&quot;)) met$Year= as.numeric(format(met$Date, &quot;%Y&quot;)) met%&gt;% filter(Year==2005&amp;d_jul&gt;=311) mutate(cumT= ifelse(Year==2005&amp;d_jul&lt;day_sewing,0,(ttmin+ttmax)/2))%&gt;% mutate(cumT= cumsum(cumT))%&gt;% filter(cumT&gt;=151&amp;cumT&lt;=155)%&gt;% select(d_jul) Figure 11.2 and Figure 11.3 shows a comparison of some STICS outputs for a wheat self-intercrop and a wheat sole crop respectively, with ilev set either at 380 like before or corrected at 329. The code used to make this output is as follows: Eval_stics= stics_eval(dir.orig = &quot;0-DATA/dummy/IC_Wheat_Wheat&quot;, dir.targ = &quot;2-Simulations/Stics_Exe/EquDens&quot;, stics = list(EquivDens= &quot;0-DATA/stics_executable/test/stics.exe&quot;), Parameter = list(ilev= list(329,380)),Plant = c(1,2), obs_name = c(&quot;6_IC_Wheat1_N0.obs&quot;,&quot;6_IC_Wheat2_N0.obs&quot;), Out_var = c(&quot;hauteur&quot;,&quot;laisen(n)&quot;,&quot;lai(n)&quot;,&quot;masec(n)&quot;,&quot;dominant&quot;,&quot;somcour&quot;), Title = &quot;Wheat-Wheat Auzeville 2005-2006 N0&quot;, plot_it = T) Figure 11.2: STICS outputs comparison with ilev= 380 and corrected to 329 on a wheat-wheat intercropping simulation experiment (Auzeville 2005-2006) The new parameter values better describe the observations for the development stages, and give simulated lai that are closer to the observations. However, the plant height is now increasing way too soon compared to the observations. These simulations were made using a version of STICS that uses the lai as a proxy for plant height. The model will soon be modified to compute it using other variables. 11.3 Checking laicomp The laicomp parameter is used to stop the exponential rate of lai growth, and is set to 0.304 for the moment. This value could be too low compared to actual conditions, so we increased the value to 0.6 and compared the outputs in Figure 11.4). Figure 11.4: STICS outputs comparison with laicomp= 0.304 and corrected to 0.6 on a wheat-wheat intercropping simulation experiment (Auzeville 2005-2006) The new parameterization of laicomp gives simulated lai that are closer to the observations when coupling with the new parameterization of ilev. These two new values (ilev= 329 and laicomp= 0.6) will be kept for future simulations. 11.4 Comparing simulated and observed lai and masec in self-IC The simulated masec for each plant of wheat or pea in self-intercrop (i.e half the density) was rightfully compared to half the plot-scale observations. However, the lai was wrongly compared to the full observation value, whereas it should be compared to half its value likewise, because the full value has to be compared to the total lai, that is computed by summing both plants lai. The observations were then divided by two to fit the lai simulations outputs that correspond to each plant, so to half values. The new outputs are shown in Figure ??). The modification tells us that the plant lai is overestimated in self-intercrop. Figure 11.4: STICS outputs comparison with half lai values on a wheat-wheat intercropping simulation experiment (Auzeville 2005-2006) 11.5 Checking durvieI The lifespan of the early leaves is expressed as a proportion of the lifespan of the late leaves, and is called durvieI. This parameter help control the steepness of the decreasing part of the lai through leaf mortality (i.e. senescence). It appears that the leaf senescence is not well simulated in the wheat sole crop, because the lai do not drop as fast as in the observations. We propose to decrease the value of durvieI from 0.8 to 0.6. A comparison of the effect of changing this value is shown in Figure 11.5) for sole crop and for 11.6) self-intercrop. Figure 11.5: STICS outputs comparison with durvieI= 0.8 compared to 0.6 on a wheat sole crop simulation experiment (Auzeville 2005-2006) Figure 11.6: STICS outputs comparison with durvieI= 0.8 compared to 0.6 on a wheat-wheat intercropping simulation experiment (Auzeville 2005-2006) "],
