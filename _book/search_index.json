Several computations are made to represent plant competition in the STICS model, making the density effect a complex process. Lets describe each step of the process to have a clearer representation in mind. 5.2 The density effect on LAI In the model, the plant density is taken as a negative effect upon the LAI growth as soon as a threshold of LAI is reached. This threshold (P_laicomp) represents the moment when the leaf surface of a plant start becoming competitive for light against another plant (from the same species or not). So whenever the LAI is higher than P_laicomp, the effect of the density (efdensite) become closer to 0 (the effect is null when equal to 1, and maximum at 0). This effect is computed as: \\(ef_{densite}=\\min\\left\\{1.0\\ ;\\ e^{P_{adens}\\cdot\\frac{log(densiteequiv)}{P_{bdens}}}\\right\\}\\) or more simply: \\(ef_{densite}=\\min\\left\\{1.0\\ ;\\ (\\frac{densiteequiv}{P_{bdens}})^{P_{adens}}\\right\\}\\) Replace the equation in the model to simplify too ? Here is a plot representing the density effect along the equivalent density: library(tidyverse) expand.grid(densiteequiv= 140:280, P_adens=c(-0.54,-0.7),P_bdens=c(7,10))%&gt;% transmute(Parameters= paste(&quot;P_adens=&quot;,P_adens,&quot;P_bdens=&quot;,P_bdens, sep=&quot;, &quot;), densiteequiv, efdensite= pmin(1.0,(exp(P_adens * (log(densiteequiv/P_bdens))))))%&gt;% arrange(Parameters)%&gt;% ggplot(aes(x=densiteequiv))+ geom_point(aes(y=efdensite,colour= Parameters))+ labs(x= &quot;Equivalent density&quot;, y= &quot;Density effect (0-1)&quot;, colour= &quot;a and b parameters values&quot;, title=&quot;Equivalent density / density effect&quot;) So the higher the density, the higher the negative effect on LAI. 5.3 The equivalent density In sole crops, the density effect is straightforward. However, under the case of mixed crops, the density effect can be higher for the dominated plant compared to its equivalent in sole crops. Indeed, a pea in sole crop would have a given competition with other close plants, but a different one when mixed with wheat, where the same density of wheat can give higher competition effect for light because it is taller. Then the density effect is computed as an equivalent density instead (densiteequiv), that can differ from the sowing density for the dominated crop to increase the negative effect of efdensite compared to a sole crop. The previous implementation in STICS was simple. As soon as a plant become dominated, it had an increased equivalent density compared to its actual density (e.g. doubled). After some discussion with the STICS intercrop team, Sebastian Munz modified the STICS code to implement a new formalism to define the equivalent density as a function of the height difference between the plants as follow: \\(density_{Equivalent} =\\begin{cases}\\Delta_{height} &gt; hauteur_{threshold} &amp; density_{p2} + \\frac{density_{p1}}{P_{bdensp1}}\\cdot P_{bdensp2} \\\\ \\Delta_{height} &lt; hauteur_{threshold} &amp; density_{p2}+slope\\cdot abs\\left|\\Delta_{height}\\right| \\end{cases}\\) with \\(diffx= \\frac{density_{p1}}{P_{bdensp1}}\\cdot P_{bdensp2}\\) and \\(slope= \\frac{diffx}{hauteur_{threshold}}\\) df_DE= data.frame(Delta_height= seq(from= 0.01, to= 1, by= 0.01)) density_p1= 140 density_p2= 30 P_bdensp1= 7 ; P_bdensp2= 1.5 hauteur_threshold= 0.2 diffx = density_p1 / P_bdensp1 * P_bdensp2 slope= diffx/hauteur_threshold Here is an exemple with a wheat-pea intercrop with a plant density of 140 for the wheat as the principal species and 30 for the pea as the associated species: df_DE%&gt;% mutate(Equ_density= ifelse(Delta_height&gt;hauteur_threshold, density_p2 + density_p1/P_bdensp1 *P_bdensp2, density_p2+slope*abs(Delta_height)) )%&gt;% ggplot(aes(y= Equ_density, x= Delta_height, colour=Equ_density))+ geom_point()+ labs(colour = &quot;Equivalent density&quot;, x = &quot;Delta height (Dominant Plant Height-Dominated Plant Height)&quot;, y= &quot;Dominated plant equivalent density&quot;, title= &quot;New formalism for equivalent plant density&quot;) The new formalism has several implications in the model, notably that the dominated plant is less impacted by the competition with the dominant plant when both have approximately the same height. A comparison of the two formalisms was made using the sticRs package, from which a summary plot was extracted, and the results are shown in Figure 5.1. The results showed that the new equvalent density computation is less severe for the dominated plant compared to the previous formalism. Consequently, the dominated plant intercepts more light (see cumraint and fapar) and has a higher LAI. Now the next step is to parameterize well the parameters for the wheat and the pea. 5.4 Proposition for a newer equivalent density E.Justes, proposed a new (third) equivalent density computation that would have no increase in equivalent density until a given threshold (hauteur_threshold_1), after which a progressive increase in the equivalent density would happen until the maximum allowed. in this computation, the slope would be computed by the model, and the resulting equivalent density would be as follows: \\(density_{Equivalent} =\\begin{cases}\\Delta_{height} &lt; hauteur_{threshold_1} &amp; density_{p2} \\\\ \\Delta_{height} &gt; hauteur_{threshold_1} &amp; b + \\Delta_{height}\\cdot slope \\\\ \\Delta_{height} &gt; hauteur_{threshold_2} &amp; Max_{equDens} \\end{cases}\\) with \\(slope= \\frac{Max_{equDens}}{hauteur_{threshold_2}-hauteur_{threshold_1}}\\) Here is the resulting plot for the same Wheat-Pea intercrop: df_DE= data.frame(Delta_height= seq(from= 0.01, to= 1, by= 0.01)) density_p1= 140 density_p2= 30 hauteur_threshold_1= 0.2 hauteur_threshold_2= 0.8 Max_equDens= 60 slope= (Max_equDens)/(hauteur_threshold_2-hauteur_threshold_1) b= density_p2-slope*hauteur_threshold_1 df_DE%&gt;% mutate(slope= (Max_equDens)/(hauteur_threshold_2-hauteur_threshold_1), Equ_density= ifelse(Delta_height&gt;hauteur_threshold_1, slope*abs(Delta_height)+b,density_p2))%&gt;% mutate(Equ_density= ifelse(Equ_density&gt;Max_equDens, Max_equDens,Equ_density))%&gt;% ggplot(aes(y= Equ_density, x= Delta_height, colour=Equ_density))+ geom_point()+ labs(colour = &quot;Equivalent density&quot;, x = &quot;Delta height (Dominant Plant Height-Dominated Plant Height)&quot;, y= &quot;Dominated plant equivalent density&quot;, title= &quot;New (third) formalism for equivalent plant density&quot;) This formalism would include three parameters: hauteur_threshold_1: the difference in height below which no competition is occuring hauteur_threshold_2: the difference in height below which a progressive competition is occuring Max_equDens: the maximum equivalent density allowed. 5.5 Proposition to remove the old explicit interspecies density competition effect For the moment, the competition induced by the density of the other species was re-included in the equivalent density computation using the P_bdensp1 and P_bdensp2 parameters, which come from the sole crop formalism, where it is used to consider intra-species competition effect. The equivalent density was originally set up to consider the decrease in light quality when a plant has another plant above it. Adding another computation of competition based on the density of the other plant could be redundant, because it is already considered during the light interception (see 6 and 2). Consequently, we propose to remove this computation from the equivalent density formalism, and to let the P_bdensp1 and P_bdensp2 parameters being used to compute the efdensite variable only. We now have to test this proposition. "]
