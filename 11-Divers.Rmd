## Introduction

This chapter keep trace of several little issues resolving with not much significance. 

## Extra code from transrad

Some pointless code was present in the `kgeom` subroutine in the `transrad.f90` file. The code assignated values to the `kg` variable twice in a row, and then `kg` was always recomputed anyway:

```{r, engine='fortran', eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
if (e > 2.1e-2) then
  kg = cos(teta1)
  kg = cos(teta2)
endif

kg = 0.5 * (cos(pi/2 + teta1) + cos(pi/2 + teta2))
kg = max(kg,0.0)
```

We propose to remove the `if...endif` code bloc. The effect of the removal of this part of code was tested against the Auzeville dataset, and as expected no change was observed in the outputs.


## Sowing density in Auzeville

The sowing density in Auzeville was set to 168 for the wheat at half-density in intercropping. We change that to the real value of 140 instead.
