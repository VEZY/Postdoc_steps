## Introduction

In STICS, the light interception is either computed using a simple Beer law assuming a homogeneous, turbid canopy, or a radiation transfer model that consider the plants leaf area index, canopy shape, height and density. The Beer law option is very simple but generally fairly accurate for high density homogeneous crops, but may rapidly yield unsatisfying predictions for stands with higher structural complexity (e.g. perennial plantations or mixed crops). For mixed crops, the model uses the radiation transfer model in a particular manner that is described in further details below.

For the case of intercrops, the model first set the taller crop as "dominant", and the shorter crop as "dominated". The model then compute the radiation interception of each one according to the dominancy, the structure (height, width, light extinction coefficient...) and position (interrow distance, row orientation) of the species. Of course, the dominancy of each plant species can be inverted if the dominated plant become taller than the dominant plant, and the model checks every day for such a case.

```{r stand initialization}
j=1              # julian day (DOY= Day Of Year)
ir= 1            # Interrow distance
l= 0.2           # Width of the plant crown
rap= 0.5         # Thickness to width ratio
haut= 1.         # Height of the part of the dominant plant above the dominated plant
                 # = hauteurzero = P_hautbase-originehaut
                 # with originehaut= dominated plant height
P_forme= 1       # Plant shape code (1= rectangle, 2= upside triangle, 3= downside tr.)
alpha= 0         # Row orientation
lat= 43.61       # Latitude in degrees
trg= 25          # Global radiation
rdif= 0.4        # Diffuse fraction of the atmospheric radiation
P_ktrou= 0.2     # Light extinction coefficient of the dominant plant
lai= 2           # Leaf area index of the dominant plant
eai= 0           # Equivalent leaf area index, = photosynthetic surface that is not from
# leaves (e.g. wheat ears, rapeseed siliquae, pea pods or grapes during their green stage)
```

To facilitate understanding, we will use a common intercrop example throughout the whole document. We take a mixed crop simulated for the day of the year `r j` with a global radiation of `r trg` MJ m-2 day-1 (= `r trg*0.48` MJ m-2 day-1 of PAR), and a diffuse fraction of light of `r rdif`, an interrow spacing of `r ir` meter, a shape of `r P_forme` (1= rectangle, 2= upside triangle and 3= downside rectangle), a canopy width of `r l` meter, a canopy thickness of `r l*rap` meter, a row orientation of `r alpha` relative to the North-South axis at latitude `r lat` degrees north, an LAI of `r lai`, a light extinction coefficient of `r P_ktrou`. The canopy of the dominant plant is `r haut` meter above the dominated plant.
All code used in this document can be viewed in each section by clicking on the `Code` button on the right.

## Plant shape

Each plant radiation interception is computed using an approximation of its shape (`P_forme`= 1, rectangle, = 2 upside triangle, = 3 downside triangle), leaf area index (`lai` or `p(i)%lai(ens,n)`), height, width, density at emergence and leaf area density (`dfol`).

### Plant width computation

First, the plant width is computed using the `formplante` function. This computation is possible thanks to the relationship between two ways for computing the plant leaf area, where one of them uses the plant width:

* First, assuming the plant has a square footprint (i.e. plant projection is square), we can find the plant leaf area using the leaf area index (`lai`) and the plant density:   
$LA=\frac{\left(lai+laisen+eai\right)}{densite}$  which is the equivalent to:   $LA=\left(lai+laisen+eai\right)\cdot interrang\cdot distrang$  
where `lai` is the leaf area index, `laisen` is the senescent leaf area index, `eai` is the equivalent leaf area of the photosynthetic organs that are not leaves (e.g. flower buds), `interrang` is the inter-row spacing and `distrang` the intra-row distance.

* Second, using the leaf area density and the plant volume such as:  
$LA=dfol\cdot largeur\cdot epaisseur\cdot profondeur$ for a cuboid and $LA=dfol\cdot\frac{1}{2}\cdot\left(largeur\cdot epaisseur\cdot profondeur\right)$ for a triangular prism, where `dfol` is the leaf area density, `largeur` is the **plant width** (also called `largtrans`), `epaisseur` is the plant thickness and `profondeur` is the plant depth.

Knowing both equations, and assuming the two following hypothesis:

1. The plant depth is equal to the plant width
2. The intra-row distance between two plants is equal to the plant width 

We can now compute the plant width as:  
$largeur=\sqrt{\frac{(lai+laisen+eai)\cdot interrang}{dfol\cdot varrapforme}}$

where `varrapforme` (or `raptrans` further) is the ratio between the plant thickness and width and is computed as $varrapforme=\frac{(hauteur-P_{hautbase})}{largeur}$ where `hauteur` is the total plant height, `P_hautbase` is the plant (i.e. crown) base height and `largeur` is the plant width (see fig \@ref(fig:Width) for more details)


![(\#fig:Width)**Diagram representing the different parameters used to compute plant width. The different names used in the model are shown between parenthesis**](img/Light-interception-dominant-1.png)

### Plant width correction

If the dominated plant is higher than the base height of the dominant plant, the radiation interception of the dominant plant is partially reduced, by reducing the volume that can intercept light to the canopy volume above the dominated plant only. This correction is made to consider the competition for light between the two species, and is computed according to the shape of the plant.

Consequently, the model first compute the height of the dominated plant (`sc%originehaut`) by looking for the maximum height between the sunlit and shaded part of the dominated plant:  
`sc%originehaut = max(p(i+1)%hauteur(sc%AO),p(i+1)%hauteur(sc%AS))`

> `sc%originehaut` is fixed to `0` (= soil) while computing the dominated plant.

Hence, the new thickness (`enouv`) is computed as:   $enouv=largeur\cdot\left|varrapforme\right|+hauteurzero$, and is used to re-compute the shape of the plant:

* The new thickness to width ratio (`raptrans`, formerly `varrapforme`): $raptrans=\frac{enouv}{largeur}$ for rectangle shaped plants,
* The new width (`largtrans`, formerly `largeur`): $largtrans=\frac{enouv}{varrapforme}$ for upsided triangle shaped plants,
* The new width (`largtrans`, formerly `largeur`): $raptrans=\frac{enouv}{largtrans}$ for downsided triangle shaped plants,

All variable names are changed, whether there is a correction or not. Here is a summary table:

```{r varmatch, echo = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
library(knitr)
kable(data.frame(Origin= c("hauteur",'largeur',"varrapforme","enouv"),
                 Modified= c("hauteur","largtrans","raptrans","enouv"),
                 Translated= c("Height", "Width","Thickness/Width Ratio","Thickness")),
      caption = "Variable name modification in the formplante function",
      col.names = c("Original", "Modified","Definition"))
```


> Upside triangle is a triangle with its base at the bottom, while downside triangle is a triangle with the base at the top.  

The correction of the shape of the plant can be summarised in the diagram Presented in Figure \@ref(fig:Comprad).

![(\#fig:Comprad)**Competition for radiation interception of the dominant plant induced by a high dominated plant**](img/Light-interception-dominant-2.png)

The correction of the shape of the plant is only used to compute the light transmitted to a plane at the dominated plant or soil height. The targeted plant interception is computed using its whole leaf area index and a light extinction coefficient.   

### Plant height

The plant height is simply computed using the plant base height, its width, and the thickness to width ratio:

$hauteur=P_{hautbase}+largeur\cdot\left|varrapforme\right|$

So indirectly, the plant height depends on its `LAI`, because the plant width is computed using it in the first place.
This formalism maybe not optimal, because the plant `height` and `LAI` are not well related during advanced plant physiological stages.  


## Light interception

The light intercepted by a plant species is obtained by computing the light reaching a horizontal plane below its canopy, either at the height of the dominated plant (for the dominant plant) of the soil (for the dominated plant). Therefore, the light incident on this plane is either coming from:  

* The incident light coming from the atmosphere, divided into two components, namely the diffuse and direct light. This light is called `rdroit` in the model,
* The light transmitted by the dominant crop, which is called `rtrans`, and that is generally of lower quality for photosynthesis. The effect of light quality is wrapped in the equivalent density formalism, see Chapter \@ref(plantdensity) for more details.

Consequently, numerous points (20, or 200 if the inter-row is lower than 1 m) are equally distributed every meter along the inter-row (*i.e.* one point every 5 cm, or every 0.5 cm with 200 points), at the height of the plane. These points are used to discretize the computation of the incident light at the surface of the plane.  
Hence, the total number of points to simulate is computed using the `interval` parameter, which is equal to 200 if the inter-row is lower than 1 meter or 20 if more. It is then used to compute the total number of points to simulate as: $N_{points}=\frac{ir}{2}\cdot interval$

>In practice, the model really simulates only half of the inter-row, because it is considered that the other half have the same light conditions at daily time-scale. For example, if we take an interrow of 10 meters, the model simulates 100 points equally distributed from 0 to 5 meters.

Here is an example of the X position on the plane, starting from the left-hand side of the row, using an inter-row spacing of `r ir` meter and a plant width of `r l` meter:

```{r x_interval, echo = TRUE, results = 'asis'}
if(ir<1.0){
  interval = 200
}else{
  interval = 20.
}
i= 1:(ir / 2 * interval)
x= (i-1) / interval
cat(paste("x=", paste(x, collapse = ", ")))
```

The points are then divided into two groups :

* The sunlit points, which are located directly under the crown of the targeted crop. 
* The shaded points, which are not directly under the crop crown, *i.e.* they have the sky above them.  

Then the semi-hemisphere above each point is discretized onto 2 x 23 angles: 23 angles from top to right, and 23 angles from top to left.
These angles are used to compute `kgdiffus`, the atmospheric diffuse radiation incident to the X point. However, if the X point is below the targeted crop canopy (`X<l/2`), only the 23 angles from the top to the right are used to compute `kgdiffus` (considering that Xs are only computed from the left-hand plants row until the middle of the inter-row, see fig.\@ref(fig:Compdominated) for more details).  

The model determines the two angles ($\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$) between which the point only receive incident light coming from the atmosphere (`rdroit`). Using these two angles (or their tangent, `G`), the model computes: 

1. The daily direct radiation (i.e. cumulated hourly radiation) that is incoming only during the time period between two hours (`h1` and `h2`) when the sun angle is between $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$. Function `kgeom` called in `rtrans`.
2. The incident diffuse radiation for all angles between $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$. Function `kdiff` called in `rtrans`.
3. The light transmitted to the plane by the target crop for all angles below $\theta_1$ or above $\theta_2$.

> In practice, all points with an x position lower than $\frac{largeur}{2}$ are shaded, and all other are sunlit, so the model computes the diffuse radiation coming from the atmosphere only for one quarter of the hemisphere for shaded Xs ; the other quarter will receive transmitted light because all angles are superior to $\theta_2$.

> Main functions used are `transrad`, `rtrans`, `kdiff` and `kgeom`.

The position of $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ (and their tangent) depends from three components: the crop shape, its inter-row spacing, and the sun azimuth (see fig. \@ref(fig:Compdominated)).

![(\#fig:Compdominated)**Diagram of the computation workflow of STICS for radiation interception for two X points placed above the dominated plant species. a. The X point is considered sunlit; b. The X point is considered shaded (right under the dominant plant canopy), so only the right-hand side of the semi-hemisphere is computed for atmospheric radiation**](img/Light-interception-dominated.png)

### Incident direct radiation from the atmosphere

The incident direct radiation for each X point is computed for all angles of the hemisphere between $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ (see \@ref(fig:Compdominated)), and summed up to integrate the semi-hemisphere of each point.

Here is an example of the computation of the direct proportion received at each X point for a crop using the `kgeom()` function:

```{r kdir, results = 'asis'}
decangle= function(j){
  theta1 = 2 * pi * (j - 80) / 365
  theta2 = 0.034 * (sin(2 * pi * j / 365) - sin(2 * pi * 80 / 365))
  theta = theta1 - theta2
  decangle = asin(0.3978 * sin(theta))

      bcrit = hcrit - acrit * theta[i]

Where $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are the angles visible in [fig.3](#fig:Compdominated) and kgdirect the proportion of the semi-hemisphere that receive direct light, considering sun position throughout the day by using stand latitude, day of year and row orientation. In the model, $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are computed in radian relative to the vertical plane above X. To provide a simpler representation, $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are also given in degrees relative to the horizontal plane (i.e. soil or dominated plant species surface) in tab.\@ref(tab:kdir).

### Incident diffuse radiation from the atmosphere

The incident diffuse radiation for all angles between $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ is computed using `G`, the apparent tangent to the considered $\theta$. First the model computes it for $\theta_1$, and uses it as a threshold under which no diffuse radiation comes from the atmosphere because only transmitted radiation reaches this angle for the considered X point. Second, the model tests if the X point is below the target crop canopy, and if not it computes `G` for $\theta_2$, and applies the same methodology, with `G` being the upper threshold this time. This method avoids computing the left-hand quarter of the hemisphere since it receives only transmitted light necessarily if it is under the targeted crop.

Here is an example of the computation of the diffuse proportion received at each X point for the same crop as above (interrow= `r ir` meter, width= `r l` meter, thickness= `r l*rap` meter, height= `r haut` meter) using the `kdif()` function:

The total diffuse radiation incident to each point X is simply the cumulative of each angle:

```{r kdifftot, results = 'asis'}
suppressWarnings(suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr)))
Output_diff%<>%
  group_by(`X index`)%>%
  summarise(kgdiffus= sum(kgdiffus))

kable(Output_diff,caption= paste("Example of the computation of the incident diffuse",
"radiation ratio kgdiffus. See introduction section for further details on the crop."))
```

### Total diffuse and direct radiation from the atmosphere incident to each X point

The total radiation from the atmosphere incident to each X point is computed by using the incident diffuse (`rdif`) and direct (`rdirect`) radiation coming from the atmosphere weighted respectively by the previously computed `kgdiffus` and `kgdirect` as follow:
$rdroit=(kgdiffus\cdot rdif)+(kgdirect\cdot rdirect)$

### Light tramsitted by the dominant crop to the X points

The light transmitted by the dominant crop to the dominated crop (`rtransmis`) is computed using the total radiation from the atmosphere incident to each X point (`rdroit`) and the effective targeted plant leaf area index as follow:

$rtransmis=(1.0-rdroit)\cdot e^{-P_{ktrou}\cdot(lai+eai)}$

where $P_{ktrou}$ is the targeted plant light extinction coefficient, `lai` the plant leaf area index, and `eai` the equivalent leaf area index, which represent the photosynthetic surface that is not from leaves (e.g. wheat ears, rapeseed pods, pea pods or grapes during their green stage).

### Total light incident to X points

The total light incident to each X point is the sum of the three components: atmospheric diffuse light, atmospheric direct light and transmitted light by the dominant crop.
Taking our previous example again, this computation leads to:

```{r}
rdirect= 1-rdif
rdroit= (Output_diff$kgdiffus*rdif)+(Output$kg*rdirect)
rtransmis = (1.0 - rdroit) * (exp(-P_ktrou * (lai + eai)))

incident_light= 
  data.frame(Output[,1:2],Total=rdroit+rtransmis, rdroit= rdroit,
             rtransmis= rtransmis, 
             light_env= ifelse(Output$`X value (m)`<limite,"Shaded","Sunlit"))
kable(incident_light,
      col.names = c("X index","X value (m)","Total incident ratio",
                    "Atmospheric ratio (rdroit)","Transmitted ratio (rtransmis)",
                    "Light environment"),
  caption=paste("Example of the computation of the total incident radiation ratio.",
                "See introduction section for further details on the crop."))
```

The Total incident ratio is computed as: `Total incident ratio= rdroit+rtransmis`. It is the proportion of the incident ligth from the atmosphere that reach the point on the plane below the plant canopy. This light either comes directly from the sky (`rdroit`) or passing through the plant canopy (`rtransmis`).
Consequently, the first point `X` of our example that is right under the plant canopy receives in average `r incident_light$Total[1]*100`% of the light coming from the atmosphere: `r incident_light$rdroit[1]*100`% of the light directly from the sky (either direct or diffuse light) + `r incident_light$rtransmis[1]*100`% of the light that is transmitted by the plant above.

### Total radiation incident to the plane

After computing the total incident ratio for each point, the model averages the values between the so-called sunlit and shaded components. Each point positioned right under the plant canopy is considered shaded, and all other is considered sunlit (see fig. \@ref(fig:Compdominated)). using our previous example, this computation gives:

```{r}
incident_light%<>%
  group_by(light_env)%>%
  summarise(Total= mean(Total))%>%
  transmute(Variable= c("rombre","rsoleil"),light_env,Total)

kable(incident_light, 
      col.names = c("STICS variable name","Light environment",
                    "Total incident light ratio"),
      caption= paste("Example of the computation of the total incident radiation",
                     "ratio for each light environment for a horizontal plane below",
                     "the targeted plant canopy. See introduction section for further",
                     "details on the crop."))
```
      
Finally, both ratios are used to compute the intercepted PAR `raint` (MJ m-2 d-1) of the target plant as:  
$raint=P_{parsurrg}\cdot trg\cdot(1-(rombre\cdot surfAO)-(rsoleil\cdot surfAS))$  
where $P_{parsurrg}$ is a coefficient to compute PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation) from the global radiation, `trg` is the active radiation (either global radiation or radiation transmitted below the dominant crop), `rombre` and `rsoleil` are the ratio of incident light for shaded and sunlit components of the plane, and `surfAO` and `surfAS` are the relative surfaces (0 to 1) of the shaded and sunlit components of the plane.
The computation of `trg` is further described in Chapter \@ref(trg).

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(magrittr)
P_parsurrg= 0.5
incident_light%<>%spread(light_env,Total)
surfAO = l/ir
surfAO = min(surfAO,1.0)
surfAS = 1.0 - surfAO
raint = P_parsurrg * trg * (1 - (incident_light$Shaded[1] * surfAO) - 
                              (incident_light$Sunlit[2]* surfAS))
```

For our example, the crop would have intercepted `r round(raint,2)` MJ m-2 day-1 of radiation, with a PAR of `r P_parsurrg * trg` W m-2, an `rombre` of `r incident_light$Shaded[1]`, an `rsoleil` of `r incident_light$Sunlit[2]` and a relative surface of `r surfAO` and `r surfAS` for the shaded and sunlit component respectively.

> The relative surfaces (0 to 1) of the shaded and sunlit components of the plane (`surfAO` and `surfAS`) that are computed during the dominant plant computation are then used as the shaded and sunlit surfaces for the dominated plant.


## Summary

The interception of the targeted plant is obtained by:

1. Computing the light that is incident at a horizontal plane at the height of the dominated plant (or the soil) and,
2. Substracting this incident light to the global PAR, which gives the PAR intercepted by the target plant.

This process is applied iteratively to the dominant and the dominated plant to compute both species PAR interception while taking account for their respective structure (shape, height, width...).

## Discussion and proposed modifications

The dominated plant interception is computed in two separate computations, one for the sunlit component, and one for the shaded component, and interception is then weighted by their relative surface. The dominant plant is considered having 100% of its surface that is sunlit, so all this computation is made only for its sunlit part.

The radiation above the dominant plant (`trg`) is the global radiation, but the radiation above the dominated plant (also `trg`) is computed as:
$trg=trg\cdot rsoleil$

where `rsoleil` is the average proportion of light intercepted by the sunlit area of the plane below the dominant plant. 

This computation is only right for the sunlit component of the dominated plant. A modification is proposed, discussed and tested on Chapter \@ref(trg).
